# Rock-Paper-Scissors-2
JavaScript rendition of Rock Paper Scissors

This is a refactor of [Rock-Paper_Scissors](https://github.com/BlueChihuahua/Rock-Paper_Scissors) to run via html buttons rather than typed text. 

Updated scoring to be displayed within the DOM rather than the console log & to announce a winner after 5 games total are either won or lost.

This project was a good exercise in how to attach a listener to specific buttons on a webpage and then work out which button the user clicked on.  

I tried to simplify the functions as much as possible & reduce repeated code once I got the game looping correctly.

I'm unhappy with the listener and game function being attached to one another, but I need to work out how to separate them without breaking functionality.
