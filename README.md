# Rock-Paper-Scissors-2
JavaScript rendition of Rock Paper Scissors

This is a refactor of Rock-Paper_Scissors to run via html buttons rather than typed text. 

Updated scoring to be displayed within the DOM rather than the console log & to announce a winner after 5 games total are either won or lost.
